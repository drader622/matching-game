## How To Play
- Click on the cards, 2 at a time, looking for matches.<br>
- If the cards are not a match, they will be flipped back over.<br>
- The user cannot have more than 2 cards opened at a time. <br> (The game will wait until both unmatched cards are flipped back over before allowing the user to select more cards.)<br>
- If they are a match, they will stay face up and become disabled from being clicked.<br>
- When all matches are found, the game is over.<br>
- Clicking restart will reset the board at anytime.


## How It's Made
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This game involves the use of arrays to store the images of NFL logos, shuffle the images, then store the images in the card elements. The game keeps track of the cards opened 2 at a time. If they are a match, they will stay displaying the logo as the user finds the next match.

## Lessons Learned
During the development of this game, I learned how to use CSS to give the cards the effect of flipping over.
